			<li>You can do anything you set your mind to, man</li>
			<li>Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity</li>
			<li>To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment</li>
			<li>Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Verse 1</h2>
		<p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
		There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
		He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
		To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
		What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
		He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
		He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now<br>
		The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!</p>

		<h2>Chorus</h2>
		<p>Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity<br>
		Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't<br>
		Give up that easy? No, he won't have it, he knows<br>
		His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope<br>
		He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows<br>
		When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's<br>
		Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody<br>
		Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and</p>

		<h2>Verse 2</h2>
		<p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
		You own it, you better never let it go<br>
		You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
		This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
		You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
		You own it, you better never let it go<br>
		You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
		This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>
