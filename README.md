# venetian

Build:

* npm install
* npm run -> produces app.js
* php build.php -> produces deploy/venetian.html with bookmarklet

# Bookmarklet

Note that the bookmarklet has to be valid JS when parsed on one line. This means no // comments and semicolons at the end of each block. 

TODO:
Mobile touch controls for starting the code
Move php build step into npm
